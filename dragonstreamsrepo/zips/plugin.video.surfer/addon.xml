    <description lang="en">The magazine was founded by John Severson in 1959 as a program to accompany his yearly surf films. Severson's photography, art and sense of humour set the pace for the future of Surfer, which quickly grew to be a reflection of the sport and culture, as well as a sounding board for surfers and environmental activists. Since 1959, Surfer Magazine has used its publication as a means of bringing readers a slice of the entire surfing world. Its editor-in-chief is Brendon Thomas; the photo editor is Grant Ellis.</description>
